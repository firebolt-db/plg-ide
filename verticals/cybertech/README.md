# CyberTech Vertical (Placeholder)

Security analytics, threat detection, and compliance use cases on Firebolt.

**Status: Placeholder.** Dataset, schema, data load scripts, and feature demos for this vertical will be added in a future release. The vertical is included in the app manifest and navigation so the structure is in place; content will follow the same patterns as Gaming, E-commerce, AdTech, Observability, and Financial (see [docs/PLAN_AND_GOVERNANCE.md](../../docs/PLAN_AND_GOVERNANCE.md)).

## Planned scope (TBD)

- Dataset and tables: TBD
- Features (e.g. aggregating indexes, partitioning, text search): TBD
- Demo comparison scripts: will follow impact-first pattern with per-step comments and `demo_progress` when added

## Directory structure (to be added)

When the vertical is implemented, it will include:

- `schema/01_tables.sql` – table DDL
- `data/load.sql` – data loading (e.g. COPY or sample data)
- `demo_comparison.sql` – impact-first comparison demo
- `features/<feature>/` – per-feature baseline/optimized SQL and README

Until then, this README serves as the placeholder for the CyberTech vertical.
